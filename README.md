Court Data Fetcher is an MVP web app built with FastAPI that scrapes Indian District and High Court portals to fetch case details (parties, filing date, next hearing, status), check if a case appears in daily causelists, and generate PDFs. It stores queries in SQLite with raw responses for record-keeping and demo purposes.
